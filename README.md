Fruit Image Classification Using CNN
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for multi-class fruit image classification. The model is trained with data augmentation techniques to improve generalization and robustness.
Features
Data augmentation during training for better model performance.
CNN architecture with multiple convolutional and pooling layers.
Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curves.
Visualization of training and validation loss and accuracy over epochs.
Usage
Prepare your dataset with images organized by class (not specified here).
Adjust the paths in the script to point to your training and validation folders.
Run the training script to train and validate the model.
Evaluate model performance on the validation set, including detailed metrics and plots.
